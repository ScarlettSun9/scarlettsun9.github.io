This is a world to share my thoughts. If you think the content here is interesting or useful, that would be my pleasure.

I used to make the website academic, but that is too serious for a personal website. So if you want to know my basic information, just click [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scarlett-sun-0935a7239/). 

BTW, if you find the names are different or confusing, don't worry. They denote to the same person.
